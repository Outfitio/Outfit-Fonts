## About

A beautiful geometric sans: The official typeface for brand automation company outfit.io

> “typefaces are the clothes words wear.” -Beatrice Warde

Inspired by the ligature-rich outfit wordmark, Outfit.io is delighted to release its own type family.
The Outfit typeface links the Outfit written voice to Outfit product marks; on brand by default. 


The proof files and QA tests are also available [automatically via GitHub Actions](https://outfitio.github.io/Outfit-Fonts/)


## Building

Fonts are built automatically by GitHub Actions

If you want to build fonts manually on your own computer:

* `make build` will produce font files.
* `make test` will run [FontBakery](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery)'s quality assurance tests.
* `make proof` will generate HTML proof files.
